# Overview
Welcome to my Analysis of the data job market, focusing on data science roles. This project was made out of a desire to navigate and understand the job market more effectively. It delves into the top-paying and in-demand skills to find the most optimal oppotunities for data scientists.

# Background
The demand for data professionals is growing rapidly. However, the job market can be confusing, with different titles, skills, and salary ranges.
This project was created to get a clearer picture of what employers are looking for and which skills are worth to focus on.

### The questions I wanna to answer through my SQl queries are:
1. What are the top paying Data Science jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What are the most in demand skills for Data Scientist?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I Used
**SQL:** to query and analyze the dataset.
**PostgreSQL:** as the database system for managing the data.

# The Analysis

### 1. Top Paying Data Science Jobs
To indetify the highest-paying roles, I filtered Data Science postings by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs only. This query highlights the top-10 paying jobs.
```sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    company_dim.name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN
    company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Scientist' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL AND
    job_location = 'Anywhere'
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
